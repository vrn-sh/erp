                    Voron is a platform that allows service providers 
                    to test deployed defenses and processes to ensure 
                    the sustainability of the system, through the missions 
                    to infiltrate corporate networks which are provided by 
                    Voron.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voron ensures that the companies who will be tested 
                    had already authorized computer attacks on their 
                    information networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volon will provide a report detailing the findings 
                    and various vulnerabilities, while attesting that 
                    the rules of engagement are being followed.
