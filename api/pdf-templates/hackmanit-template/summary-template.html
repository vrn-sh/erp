        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>DENIC ID is the rst widely-deployed implementation of the ID4me protocol [1]. ID4me is
                a novel protocol for federated identity management whose two main goals are to provide
                (1) Authorization of a user for access to any third party accepting ID4me identiers
                and (2) Controlled communication of the user's personal information to the third parties
                accessed by the user [1]. ID4me is based on well-established standards such as OpenID
                Connect [8] and the domain name system (DNS) [4].</p>
            <p>Hackmanit GmbH was commissioned to perform a penetration test on a relying party in
                the context of DENIC ID - the new DENIC Member Login page. The penetration test
                was performed remotely with a total expense of 11 PT.</p>
            <p><span>Weaknesses.</span> During the penetration test, three weaknesses classied as Medium were
                identied. Two of these weaknesses relate to the insucient protection against cross-site
                request forgery (CSRF) attacks. First, the login page does not contain CSRF protection
                mechanisms like CSRF tokens, which allows an attacker to force a victim to start an
                authentication ow without its consent. Second, the presence of the state parameter,
                which is used to protect against CSRF attacks in the OpenID Connect protocol, is not
                enforced by the relying party. This enables an attacker to log a victim into an account
                controlled by the attacker which might result in the victim revealing personal information
                or les to the attacker. The third weakness could allow an attacker to compromise the
                account of a victim due to faulty session and cookie management when the victim logs in
                again after a successful logout using the same browser. Some of the weaknesses identied
                during the penetration test are weaknesses in the library OpenID-Connect-PHP1 which
                the tested relying party is based on. We responsibly disclosed these weaknesses to the
                library developers in June 2019 and supported them by implementing security xes.</p>
            <p><span>Structure.</span> The report is structured as follows: In Section 2, the timeline of the penetration test is
                listed. Section 3 introduces our methodology, and Section 4 explains the
                general conditions and scope of the penetration test. In section 5, the scenario of the
                penetration test is described in detail. Section 6 provides an overview of the identied
                weaknesses and further recommendations. In Section 7, all identied weaknesses are discussed in detail
                and specic countermeasures are described. Section 8 summarizes our
                recommendations resulting from observations of the application. Finally, Section 9 lists
                additional tests that did not reveal any weaknesses.</p>
