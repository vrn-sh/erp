                NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center in
                Pasadena,
                California.
                Since 1959, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has been under contract with NASA to manage
                JPL, most
                prominently its research and development activities, but also its network security controls. Under the
                contract, NASA
                retains responsibility for ensuring Agency data and systems at JPL are secure from hackers or other
                forms of
                unauthorized access.</p>
            <p>
                JPL’s information technology (IT) systems maintain a wide public internet presence while supporting
                missions
                and
                networks that control spacecraft, collect and process scientific data, and perform critical operations.
                Over
                the past
                10 years, JPL has experienced several notable cybersecurity incidents that have compromised major
                segments
                of its
                IT network. For example, in 2011 cyber intruders gained full access to 18 servers supporting key JPL
                missions and stole
                87 gigabytes of data. More recently, in April 2018 JPL discovered an account belonging to an external
                user
                had been
                compromised and used to steal approximately 500 megabytes of data from one of its major mission systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this audit, we assessed the effectiveness of JPL’s network security controls for externally facing
                applications and
                systems. We also examined elements of JPL’s Cybersecurity Program and NASA’s interaction with and
                oversight
                of
                the IT security control responsibilities assigned to Caltech under its contract to manage JPL. To
                complete
                this work,
                we interviewed NASA and JPL IT officials and reviewed JPL’s IT network mapping, system inventory, and
                security
                management tools. We also reviewed federal, NASA, JPL, and Caltech criteria, policies, procedures,
                supporting
                documentation, agreements, prior audit reports, external reviews, and other documents related to
                cybersecurity.

        <div class="section-text">
            <p>
                Multiple IT security control weaknesses reduce JPL’s ability to prevent, detect, and mitigate attacks
                targeting its systems
                and networks, thereby exposing NASA systems and data to exploitation by cyber criminals. JPL uses its
                Information
                Technology Security Database (ITSDB) to track and manage physical assets and applications on its
                network; however,
                we found the database inventory incomplete and inaccurate, placing at risk JPL’s ability to effectively
                monitor, report,
                and respond to security incidents. Moreover, reduced visibility into devices connected to its networks
                hinders JPL’s
                ability to properly secure those networks. Further, we found that JPL’s network gateway that controls
                partner access to
                a shared IT environment for specific missions and data had not been properly segmented to limit users
                only to those
                systems and applications for which they had approved access. This shortcoming enabled an attacker to
                gain unauthorized
                access to JPL’s mission network through a compromised external user system. Additionally, NASA failed to
                establish
                Interconnection Security Agreements (ISA) to document the requirements partners must meet to connect to
                NASA’s
                IT systems and describe the security controls that will be used to protect the systems and data.
                We also found that security problem log tickets, created in the ITSDB when a potential or actual IT
                system security
                vulnerability is identified, were not resolved for extended periods of time—sometimes longer than 180
                days. While
                system administrators may request a waiver when they cannot resolve such tickets within 6 months, we
                found waivers
                were not reviewed annually as required, resulting in unnecessary waivers and potentially outdated
                compensating security controls that expose the JPL network to exploitation by cyberattacks. Further, JPL
                system administrators
                misunderstood their responsibilities regarding management and review of logs for identifying malicious
                activity
                occurring on a particular system or network. We also found that while cybersecurity monitoring tools
                employed by JPL
                defend against routine intrusions and misuse of computer assets, JPL had not implemented a threat
                hunting program
                recommended by IT security experts to aggressively pursue abnormal activity on its systems for signs of
                compromise,
                and instead rely on an ad hoc process to search for intruders. In addition, JPL had not provided
                role-based security
                training or funded IT security certifications for its system administrators. </p>
            <p>
                Further, we found that multiple JPL incident management and response practices deviate from NASA and
                recommended
                industry practices. For example, unlike NASA’s Security Operations Center (SOC), JPL’s SOC does not
                maintain
                round-the-clock availability of IT security incident responders and JPL’s incident response plan does
                not include all
                federally-recommended elements. In addition, team coordination issues delayed completion of incident
                containment
                and eradication steps for the April 2018 incident. Moreover, while documenting and sharing cyber threat
                information
                across JPL to help prevent future incidents is a critical component of an effective incident response
                program, we found
                JPL’s current initiatives fall short.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, while the contract between NASA and Caltech requires JPL to report certain types of IT security
                incidents to the
                Agency through the NASA SOC incident management system, no controls were in place to ensure JPL
                compliance with
                this requirement nor did NASA officials have access to JPL’s incident management system. Collectively,
                these
                weaknesses leave NASA data and systems at risk
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite these significant concerns, the contract NASA signed with Caltech in October 2018 to manage JPL
                for at least the
                next 5 years left important IT security requirements unresolved and instead both sides agreed to
                continue negotiating
                these issues. As of March 2019, the Agency had not approved JPL’s plans to implement new IT security
                policies and
                requirements NASA included in its October 2018 contract.

                To improve JPL network security controls, we recommended the Director of the NASA Management Office
                instruct the
                JPL Chief Information Officer (CIO) to: (1) require system administrators to review and update the ITSDB
                and ensure
                system components are properly registered and the JPL Cybersecurity/Identity Technologies and Operations
                Group
                (CITO) periodically review compliance with this requirement; (2) segregate shared environments connected
                to the
                network gateway and monitor partners accessing the JPL network; (3) review and update ISAs for all
                partners connected
                to the gateway; (4) require the JPL CITO to identify and remediate weaknesses in the security problem
                log ticket process
                and provide periodic aging reports to the JPL CIO; (5) require the JPL CITO to validate, update, and
                perform annual
                reviews of all open waivers; (6) clarify the division of responsibility between the JPL Office of the
                Chief Information
                Officer and system administrators for conducting routine log reviews and monitor compliance on a more
                frequent basis;
                (7) implement the planned role-based training program by July 2019; (8) establish a formal, documented
                threat-hunting
                process; and (9) develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for institutional IT knowledge and
                incident management
                that includes dissemination of lessons learned. We also recommended the NASA CIO include requirements in
                the pending
                IT Transition Plan that provide the NASA SOC with sufficient control and visibility into JPL network
                security practices.. </p>
            <p>
                We provided a draft of this report to NASA management who concurred with 9 of our 10 recommendations and
                described corrective actions it has taken or will take. We consider management’s comments to those
                recommendations
                responsive and therefore the recommendations are resolved and will be closed upon completion and
                verification of the
                proposed corrective actions. Management did not concur with Recommendation 8 related to establishing a
                cybersecurity threat-hunting capability and this recommendation will
                remain unresolved pending further discussion with the Agency.
